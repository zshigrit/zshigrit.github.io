<h1>Shi Lab — Ecosystem Modeling and Soil Carbon Dynamics</h1>

<p>
We study terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling using field experiments,
data synthesis, and mechanistic and machine-learning models.
Our research focuses on soil carbon dynamics, microbial processes,
and improving Earth system model predictions under climate change.
