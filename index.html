    <h1>Zheng Shi, Ph.D.</h1>

    <p>
      Research Scientist<br>
      Institute for Environmental Genomics, University of Oklahoma
    </p>

    <p>
      I develop quantitative frameworks that integrate ecosystem ecology, biological statistics,
      and process-based modeling to understand how plant and soil systems respond to environmental change.
      My research combines long-term field experiments, global data synthesis, mechanistic modeling,
      and machine learning to improve prediction and uncertainty quantification of terrestrial carbon cycling.
    </p>

    <p>
      I received my Ph.D. in Global Change Ecology from the University of Oklahoma and previously held
      postdoctoral appointments at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of California, Irvine.
      I am currently a Research Scientist at the Institute for Environmental Genomics at the University of Oklahoma.

    <!-- LAB / RESEARCH OVERVIEW -->
    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Data-driven understanding and prediction of ecosystem dynamics</h2>

    <p>
      The EcoDynamics Lab studies terrestrial ecosystem biogeochemical cycling using field experiments,
      data synthesis, mechanistic modeling, and machine learning. Our research focuses on plant and soil carbon
      dynamics, microbial processes, and improving Earth system model predictions under climate change.
    </p>

    <p>
      A major goal of the lab is to reduce uncertainty in land carbon cycle projections by integrating experimental
      benchmarks (e.g., warming and precipitation manipulations), global datasets including radiocarbon constraints,
      and model evaluation frameworks. We develop tools for benchmarking and diagnosis of land models and explore hybrid
      approaches that combine process-based models with modern machine learning methods.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:28px;">Current research directions</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Field experiment: long-term temporal responses of plant and microbial communities and carbon cycle to environmental change</li>
      <li>Data synthesis: spatial responses of plant and soil carbon dynamics to environmental change</li>
      <li>Mechanistic modeling: mechanisms and uncertainties in ecosystem and soil carbon response to climate change</li>
      <li>Machine learning: combining process-based models with machine learning for mechanisms identification and extrapolation</li>
