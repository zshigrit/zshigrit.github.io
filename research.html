        <h2>Ecosystem Responses to Environmental Change: field experiments and data synthesis</h2>

        <p>
          Plant productivity and soil respiration are the two largest carbon fluxes into and out of ecosystems, and their balance
          determines ecosystem carbon sequestration. Climate change and land management practices profoundly affect both fluxes.
          Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), structure equation
          modeling (SEM), and meta-analysis, I have revealed critical mechanisms that determine ecosystem responses to environmental change.
          For example, in a tallgrass prairie, experimental warming and hay harvest altered plant community composition and diversity
          (Shi et al. 2015 Journal of Ecology), which in turn promoted plant productivity and enhanced its temporal stability
          (Shi et al. 2016 Nature Communications). The shifted community also amplified the response of soil respiration to warming over time
          (Xu and Shi et al. 2015 Global Change Biology). Together, these changes led toward carbon neutrality, where increased productivity
          was balanced by enhanced soil respiration (Shi et al. 2015 Ecosphere). In another field experiment, I found that plant productivity
          responded strongly to drought and increased precipitation, but not to warming (Shi et al. 2018 Global Change Biology).
          Soil carbon stocks remained stable, reflecting the unchanged carbon balance under altered temperature and precipitation
          (Xu# and Shi# et al. 2016 Global Change Biology; #equal contribution). To extend these experimental insights to management and
          policy-relevant scales, I conducted global syntheses. A meta-analysis of 83 precipitation experiments revealed that mesic grasslands
          were more sensitive to decreased precipitation but less sensitive to increased precipitation compared with arid grasslands
          (Wilcox# and Shi# et al. 2017 Global Change Biology). Another meta-analysis showed that asymmetric responses of productivity and
          respiration to drought were strongest in grasslands relative to forests and savannas (Shi et al. 2014 Biogeosciences).
          Meanwhile, our synthesis of global warming experiments demonstrated no consistent evidence for either positive or negative soil carbon
          sequestration across ecosystems (van Gestel and Shi et al. 2018 Nature).
