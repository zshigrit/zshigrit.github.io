    <p>
      Plant productivity and soil
      respiration are the two largest carbon fluxes into and out of ecosystems, and their balance
      determines ecosystem carbon sequestration. Climate change and land management practices
      profoundly affect both fluxes. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component
      analysis (PCA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), structure equation modeling (SEM), and
      meta-analysis, I have revealed critical mechanisms that determine ecosystem responses to
      environmental change. For example, in a tallgrass prairie, experimental warming and hay harvest
      altered plant community composition and diversity (Shi et al. 2015 Journal of Ecology), which in
      turn promoted plant productivity and enhanced its temporal stability (Shi et al. 2016 Nature
      Communications). The shifted community also amplified the response of soil respiration to
      warming over time (Xu and Shi et al. 2015 Global Change Biology). Together, these changes led
      toward carbon neutrality, where increased productivity was balanced by enhanced soil respiration
      (Shi et al. 2015 Ecosphere). In another field experiment, I found that plant productivity responded
      strongly to drought and increased precipitation, but not to warming (Shi et al. 2018 Global Change
      Biology). Soil carbon stocks remained stable, reflecting the unchanged carbon balance under
      altered temperature and precipitation (Xu# and Shi# et al. 2016 Global Change Biology; #equal
      contribution). To extend these experimental insights to management and policy-relevant scales, I
      conducted global syntheses. A meta-analysis of 83 precipitation experiments revealed that mesic
      grasslands were more sensitive to decreased precipitation but less sensitive to increased
      precipitation compared with arid grasslands (Wilcox# and Shi# et al. 2017 Global Change Biology).
      Another meta-analysis showed that asymmetric responses of productivity and respiration to
      drought were strongest in grasslands relative to forests and savannas (Shi et al. 2014
      Biogeosciences). Meanwhile, our synthesis of global warming experiments demonstrated no
      consistent evidence for either positive or negative soil carbon sequestration across ecosystems (van
      Gestel and Shi et al. 2018 Nature).

    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Soil carbon persistence and dynamics: data-driven modeling and upscaling with machine learning</h2>
    <p>
      Another major theme of my research focuses on identifying key processes of soil carbon
      sequestration using multi-source datasets. The goal is to develop data-driven models and reduce
      uncertainty in long-term soil carbon predictions. By assimilating global microbial and soil carbon
      datasets, we found that two complex soil carbon models predicted widely varying magnitudes and
      directions of global carbon sequestration (Shi et al. 2018 Nature Communications). In contrast, a
      simpler, data-constrained model predicted small positive sequestration. This work emphasized that
      diverse model structures increase confidence in projections, but that excessive complexity can also
      amplify uncertainty. We highlighted the need for balance between model realism and structural
      diversity, alongside improved global datasets for model constraint. One of the most critical datasets for constraining model predictions is soil radiocarbon abundance, a robust indicator of carbon
      persistence. We compiled thousands of site-level radiocarbon measurements (Lawrence, …Shi et
      al. 2020 Earth System Science Data) and upscaled these using ML algorithms to produce global
      radiocarbon maps (Shi et al. 2020, Nature Geoscience). Our results showed that climate dominates
      topsoil radiocarbon variability, while soil depth controls deeper carbon age distributions.
      Compared with Earth System Model (ESM) outputs, the ML-upscaled data revealed that existing
      models overestimate soil carbon sequestration under global change. Building on this work, I
      demonstrated that global-scale model convergence across multiple ESMs can mask deep
      inconsistencies in predicted soil carbon changes (Shi et al. 2024, AGU Advances). Furthermore,
      using over 70,000 soil carbon profiles and deep learning algorithms, we found that carbon use
      efficiency is at least four times as influential as carbon input, decomposition, or vertical transport
      in determining global soil carbon storage (Tao,…Shi et al. 2023 Nature). Together, these studies
      define a quantitative, data-informed framework for improving how global models represent soil
      carbon dynamics, persistence, and uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond prediction, we use ML for mechanism discovery—e.g., quantifying the relative influence of carbon use efficiency versus
      other processes—and to build ML-enabled benchmarking and emulator frameworks that support scalable diagnosis, uncertainty mapping,
      and model development.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Machine Learning–Enabled Model Benchmarking and development</h2>
    <p>
      My group will apply ML to detect structural errors and inconsistencies in
      multi-model ensembles, building on my recent
      work (Shi et al. 2024 AGU Advances). We will develop deep
      learning emulators that reproduce the behavior
      of land carbon models, allowing scalable
      benchmarking across ESMs. These emulators
      will support the creation of diagnostic
      uncertainty maps that pinpoint where model
      convergence conceals mechanistic divergence.
      For model development and parameter
      learning, I will design a coupled deep learning
      system that integrates feed-forward neural
      networks (NNs) and long short-term memory
      (LSTM) NNs. The LSTM will address
      temporal autocorrelation, particularly for
      carbon pool variables such as plant biomass and soil carbon. Importantly, model parameters will
      be included as features within the emulator, enabling it to learn parameter sensitivities and biases.
      A secondary neural network will perform statistical parameter learning, using experimental
      benchmarks as labels. This end-to-end, label-free training architecture allows the emulator to infer
      and correct model biases, thereby reducing uncertainty in carbon–climate feedback projections.

    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Application of ML to microbial biome analysis and ecosystem modeling</h2>
    <p>
      Machine learning is
      transforming microbial ecology by enabling the classification, prediction, and interpretation of
      complex, high-dimensional data. Classical algorithms such as random forests, support vector
      machines, and gradient boosting have long supported taxonomic classification and biomarker discovery. More recently, deep learning architectures—including convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer-based embeddings—have enhanced
our ability to model microbial temporal dynamics and integrate multi-omics data. These tools not
only improve predictive accuracy but also enable discovery of novel ecological patterns that
traditional statistical approaches cannot easily capture. To enhance interpretability, my group will
employ explainable AI methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Locally
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to ensure that predictions highlight
ecologically meaningful drivers such as microbial interactions, keystone taxa, or functional guilds.
Leveraging one of the longest-running
field experiments at OU’s Kessler Farm
(Figure 2), where temperature,
precipitation, and harvest treatments have
been continuously manipulated since
2009, we will integrate microbial
dynamics into ecosystem carbon models
using ML. The central hypothesis is that
microbial temporal dynamics encode
information about functional traits (e.g.,
carbon use efficiency, mortality rate)
relevant to soil carbon cycling. Through
this approach, we aim to bridge microbial
ecology and ecosystem carbon cycle,
offering new predictive capacity for
global carbon–climate feedback.
Together, these advances demonstrate
how ML methods are not only improving
our ability to classify and predict
microbial community dynamics but also
reshaping the way microbial ecology
interfaces with ecosystem and climate
research. These efforts will establish a
data–model integration hub at OU,
bridging biology, statistics, and Earth system science. I envision close
collaboration with the School of Biological Sciences, the Institute for Environmental Genomics,
and national laboratory partners to co-develop open-source algorithms for biological model
calibration, benchmarking, and ML integration. My long-term vision is to contribute to OU’s
growing strength in quantitative biology by fostering collaborations where biological statistics
connect data science, ecology, and climate modeling to better understand Earth’s dynamic
biosphere.
