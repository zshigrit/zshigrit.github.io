Ecosystem Responses to Environmental Change:
field experiments and data synthesis
</h2>

<p>
Plant productivity and soil respiration represent the two largest carbon fluxes
entering and leaving ecosystems. Their balance determines ecosystem carbon
sequestration under climate change.
Using long-term manipulative experiments and global meta-analysis,
my research quantifies plant and soil mechanisms controlling ecosystem responses
to environmental change.

<p>
In a tallgrass prairie experiment, warming and hay harvest altered plant community
composition and diversity

which increased productivity stability
(<a class="ref" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11973" target="_blank">Shi et&nbsp;al. 2016 Nature Communications</a>)
and amplified soil respiration responses to warming
(<a class="ref" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12940" target="_blank">Xu & Shi et&nbsp;al. 2015 GCB</a>).
Together these shifts produced ecosystem carbon neutrality

</p>

<p>
Additional experiments revealed strong productivity responses to altered
precipitation but limited sensitivity to warming
(<a class="ref" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Shi+2018+Global+Change+Biology" target="_blank">Shi et&nbsp;al. 2018 GCB</a>),
while soil carbon stocks remained stable

<p>
To extend experimental understanding globally, I conducted syntheses showing
grassland sensitivity to precipitation extremes

    Soil carbon persistence and dynamics:
    data-driven modeling and upscaling with machine learning
  </h2>

  <div class="research-grid">

<div>
<p>
A second major theme of my research focuses on identifying key processes of soil carbon sequestration using multi-source datasets. 
  The goal is to develop data-driven models and reduce uncertainty in long-term soil carbon predictions. By assimilating global microbial and soil carbon datasets, 
  we found that two complex soil carbon models predicted widely varying magnitudes and directions of global carbon sequestration 
(<a class="ref" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04526-9" target="_blank">Shi et&nbsp;al. 2018 Nature Communications</a>).
In contrast, a simpler, data-constrained model predicted small positive sequestration. This work emphasized that diverse model structures increase confidence in projections, 
  but that excessive complexity can also amplify uncertainty. We highlighted the need for balance between model realism and structural diversity, 
  alongside improved global datasets for model constraint. One of the most critical datasets for constraining model predictions is 
  soil radiocarbon abundance, a robust indicator of carbon persistence. We compiled thousands of site-level radiocarbon measurements 
(<a class="ref" href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/61/2020/" target="_blank">Lawrence … Shi et&nbsp;al. 2020 ESSD</a>)
and and upscaled these using ML algorithms to produce global radiocarbon maps
(<a class="ref" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-0596-z" target="_blank">Shi et&nbsp;al. 2020 Nature Geoscience</a>). 
  Our results showed that climate dominates topsoil radiocarbon variability, while soil depth controls deeper carbon age distributions. 
  Compared with Earth System Model (ESM) outputs, the ML-upscaled data revealed that existing models overestimate soil carbon sequestration under global change. Building on this work, 
  I demonstrated that global-scale model convergence across multiple ESMs can mask deep inconsistencies in predicted soil carbon changes
(<a class="ref" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023AV001068" target="_blank">Shi et&nbsp;al. 2024 AGU Advances</a>).
  Furthermore, using over 70,000 soil carbon profiles and deep learning algorithms, we found that carbon use efficiency is at least four times as influential as carbon input, 
  decomposition, or vertical transport in determining global soil carbon storage 
(<a class="ref" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06042-3" target="_blank">Tao … Shi et&nbsp;al. 2023 Nature</a>). Together, these studies define a quantitative, 
  data-informed framework for improving how global models represent soil carbon dynamics, persistence, and uncertainty.

Machine Learning–Enabled Model Benchmarking and Development
</h2>

<p>
My group will apply ML to detect structural errors and inconsistencies in multi-model ensembles, building on my recent AGU Advances work. 
  We will develop deep learning emulators that reproduce the behavior of land carbon models, allowing scalable benchmarking across ESMs. 
  These emulators will support the creation of diagnostic uncertainty maps that pinpoint where model convergence conceals mechanistic divergence. 
  For model development and parameter learning, I will design a coupled deep learning system that integrates feed-forward neural networks (NNs) 
  and long short-term memory (LSTM) NNs. The LSTM will address temporal autocorrelation, particularly for carbon pool variables such as plant biomass 
  and soil carbon. Importantly, model parameters will be included as features within the emulator, enabling it to learn parameter sensitivities and biases. 
  A secondary neural network will perform statistical parameter learning, using experimental benchmarks as labels. This end-to-end, label-free 
  training architecture allows the emulator to infer and correct model biases, thereby reducing uncertainty in carbon–climate feedback projections.

Machine Learning for Microbial Biome Analysis and Ecosystem Modeling
</h2>

<p>
Machine learning is transforming microbial ecology by enabling the classification, prediction, and interpretation of complex, high-dimensional data. 
Classical algorithms such as random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting have long supported taxonomic classification and biomarker
  discovery. More recently, deep learning architectures—including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), 
  and transformer-based embeddings—have enhanced our ability to model microbial temporal dynamics and integrate multi-omics data. 
  These tools not only improve predictive accuracy but also enable discovery of novel ecological patterns that traditional statistical approaches cannot easily capture. 
  To enhance interpretability, my group will employ explainable AI methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and 
  Locally Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to ensure that predictions highlight ecologically meaningful drivers such as microbial interactions, 
  keystone taxa, or functional guilds. Leveraging one of the longest-running field experiments at OU’s Kessler Farm (Figure 2), where temperature, precipitation, 
  and harvest treatments have been continuously manipulated since 2009, we will integrate microbial dynamics into ecosystem carbon models. The central hypothesis 
  is that microbial temporal dynamics encode information about functional traits (e.g., carbon use efficiency, mortality rate) relevant to soil carbon cycling. 
  Through this approach, we aim to bridge microbial ecology and ecosystem carbon cycle, offering new predictive capacity for global carbon–climate feedback. 
  Together, these advances demonstrate how ML methods are not only improving our ability to classify and predict microbial community dynamics but also reshaping 
  the way microbial ecology interfaces with ecosystem and climate research. These efforts will establish a data–model integration hub at OU, bridging biology, statistics, and Earth system science. 
  I envision close collaboration with the School of Biological Sciences, the Institute for Environmental Genomics, and national laboratory biological model calibration, benchmarking, and ML integration. 
  My long-term vision is to contribute to OU’s growing strength in quantitative biology by 
  fostering collaborations where biological statistics connect data science, ecology, and climate modeling to better understand Earth’s dynamic biosphere.
