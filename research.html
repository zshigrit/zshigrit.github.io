          Ecosystem Responses to Environmental Change: field experiments and data synthesis
        </h2>

        <p>
          Plant productivity and soil
          respiration are the two largest carbon fluxes into and out of ecosystems, and their balance
          determines ecosystem carbon sequestration. Climate change and land management practices
          profoundly affect both fluxes. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component
          analysis (PCA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), structure equation modeling (SEM), and
          meta-analysis, I have revealed critical mechanisms that determine ecosystem responses to
          environmental change. For example, in a tallgrass prairie, experimental warming and hay harvest
          altered plant community composition and diversity (Shi et al. 2015 Journal of Ecology), which in
          turn promoted plant productivity and enhanced its temporal stability (Shi et al. 2016 Nature
          Communications). The shifted community also amplified the response of soil respiration to
          warming over time (Xu and Shi et al. 2015 Global Change Biology). Together, these changes led
          toward carbon neutrality, where increased productivity was balanced by enhanced soil respiration
          (Shi et al. 2015 Ecosphere). In another field experiment, I found that plant productivity responded
          strongly to drought and increased precipitation, but not to warming (Shi et al. 2018 Global Change
          Biology). Soil carbon stocks remained stable, reflecting the unchanged carbon balance under
          altered temperature and precipitation (Xu# and Shi# et al. 2016 Global Change Biology; #equal
          contribution). To extend these experimental insights to management and policy-relevant scales, I
          conducted global syntheses. A meta-analysis of 83 precipitation experiments revealed that mesic
          grasslands were more sensitive to decreased precipitation but less sensitive to increased
          precipitation compared with arid grasslands (Wilcox# and Shi# et al. 2017 Global Change Biology).
          Another meta-analysis showed that asymmetric responses of productivity and respiration to
          drought were strongest in grasslands relative to forests and savannas (Shi et al. 2014
          Biogeosciences). Meanwhile, our synthesis of global warming experiments demonstrated no
          consistent evidence for either positive or negative soil carbon sequestration across ecosystems (van
          Gestel and Shi et al. 2018 Nature).

        <h2>Soil carbon persistence and dynamics: data-driven modeling and upscaling with machine learning</h2>
        <p>
          Another major theme of my research focuses on identifying key processes of soil carbon
          sequestration using multi-source datasets. The goal is to develop data-driven models and reduce
          uncertainty in long-term soil carbon predictions. By assimilating global microbial and soil carbon
          datasets, we found that two complex soil carbon models predicted widely varying magnitudes and
          directions of global carbon sequestration (Shi et al. 2018 Nature Communications). In contrast, a
          simpler, data-constrained model predicted small positive sequestration. This work emphasized that
          diverse model structures increase confidence in projections, but that excessive complexity can also
          amplify uncertainty. We highlighted the need for balance between model realism and structural
          diversity, alongside improved global datasets for model constraint. One of the most critical datasets for constraining model predictions is soil radiocarbon abundance, a robust indicator of carbon
          persistence. We compiled thousands of site-level radiocarbon measurements (Lawrence, …Shi et
          al. 2020 Earth System Science Data) and upscaled these using ML algorithms to produce global
          radiocarbon maps (Shi et al. 2020, Nature Geoscience). Our results showed that climate dominates
          topsoil radiocarbon variability, while soil depth controls deeper carbon age distributions.
          Compared with Earth System Model (ESM) outputs, the ML-upscaled data revealed that existing
          models overestimate soil carbon sequestration under global change. Building on this work, I
          demonstrated that global-scale model convergence across multiple ESMs can mask deep
          inconsistencies in predicted soil carbon changes (Shi et al. 2024, AGU Advances). Furthermore,
          using over 70,000 soil carbon profiles and deep learning algorithms, we found that carbon use
          efficiency is at least four times as influential as carbon input, decomposition, or vertical transport
          in determining global soil carbon storage (Tao,…Shi et al. 2023 Nature). Together, these studies
          define a quantitative, data-informed framework for improving how global models represent soil
          carbon dynamics, persistence, and uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond prediction, we use ML for mechanism discovery—e.g., quantifying the relative influence of carbon use efficiency versus
          other processes—and to build ML-enabled benchmarking and emulator frameworks that support scalable diagnosis, uncertainty mapping,
          and model development.

        <h2>Machine Learning–Enabled Model Benchmarking and development</h2>
        <p>
          My group will apply ML to detect structural errors and inconsistencies in
          multi-model ensembles, building on my recent
          work (Shi et al. 2024 AGU Advances). We will develop deep
          learning emulators that reproduce the behavior
          of land carbon models, allowing scalable
          benchmarking across ESMs. These emulators
          will support the creation of diagnostic
          uncertainty maps that pinpoint where model
          convergence conceals mechanistic divergence.
          For model development and parameter
          learning, I will design a coupled deep learning
          system that integrates feed-forward neural
          networks (NNs) and long short-term memory
          (LSTM) NNs. The LSTM will address
          temporal autocorrelation, particularly for
          carbon pool variables such as plant biomass and soil carbon. Importantly, model parameters will
          be included as features within the emulator, enabling it to learn parameter sensitivities and biases.
          A secondary neural network will perform statistical parameter learning, using experimental
          benchmarks as labels. This end-to-end, label-free training architecture allows the emulator to infer
          and correct model biases, thereby reducing uncertainty in carbon–climate feedback projections.

        <h2>Application of ML to microbial biome analysis and ecosystem modeling</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning is
          transforming microbial ecology by enabling the classification, prediction, and interpretation of
          complex, high-dimensional data. Classical algorithms such as random forests, support vector
          machines, and gradient boosting have long supported taxonomic classification and biomarker discovery. More recently, deep learning architectures—including convolutional neural networks
          (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer-based embeddings—have enhanced
          our ability to model microbial temporal dynamics and integrate multi-omics data. These tools not
          only improve predictive accuracy but also enable discovery of novel ecological patterns that
          traditional statistical approaches cannot easily capture. To enhance interpretability, my group will
          employ explainable AI methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Locally
          Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to ensure that predictions highlight
          ecologically meaningful drivers such as microbial interactions, keystone taxa, or functional guilds.
          Leveraging one of the longest-running
          field experiments at OU’s Kessler Farm
          (Figure 2), where temperature,
          precipitation, and harvest treatments have
          been continuously manipulated since
          2009, we will integrate microbial
          dynamics into ecosystem carbon models
          using ML. The central hypothesis is that
          microbial temporal dynamics encode
          information about functional traits (e.g.,
          carbon use efficiency, mortality rate)
          relevant to soil carbon cycling. Through
          this approach, we aim to bridge microbial
          ecology and ecosystem carbon cycle,
          offering new predictive capacity for
          global carbon–climate feedback.
          Together, these advances demonstrate
          how ML methods are not only improving
          our ability to classify and predict
          microbial community dynamics but also
          reshaping the way microbial ecology
          interfaces with ecosystem and climate
          research. These efforts will establish a
          data–model integration hub at OU,
          bridging biology, statistics, and Earth system science. I envision close
          collaboration with the School of Biological Sciences, the Institute for Environmental Genomics,
          and national laboratory partners to co-develop open-source algorithms for biological model
          calibration, benchmarking, and ML integration. My long-term vision is to contribute to OU’s
          growing strength in quantitative biology by fostering collaborations where biological statistics
          connect data science, ecology, and climate modeling to better understand Earth’s dynamic
          biosphere.
