  <h1>Research Themes</h1>

  <div style="height:20px;"></div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Field Experiments</h2>
    <p>
      We quantify ecosystem responses to environmental change by linking plant productivity and soil respiration—
      the two largest carbon fluxes that jointly determine ecosystem carbon sequestration. Our work leverages
      long-term field manipulations (e.g., warming, altered precipitation, and land management such as hay harvest)
      to reveal how plant community composition, microbial activity, and ecosystem carbon cycling co-evolve through time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key emphasis is identifying mechanisms (and their time dependence) that control carbon balance and stability,
      using rigorous statistical inference (e.g., mixed-effects models, multivariate analysis, and structural approaches)
      and extending site-level insights to broader, management-relevant understanding through synthesis.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div style="height:20px;"></div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Data Synthesis</h2>
    <p>
      We integrate multi-source datasets to constrain patterns and drivers of soil carbon storage, turnover, and persistence
      across space. This includes global syntheses and meta-analyses that test whether ecosystem carbon responses exhibit
      consistent directions under warming, drought, and precipitation extremes, and when they do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major focus is using global observational constraints—especially soil radiocarbon datasets—as an anchor for evaluating
      soil carbon persistence and diagnosing model–data mismatches at scales relevant for policy and Earth system prediction.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div style="height:20px;"></div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Mechanistic Modeling</h2>
    <p>
      We develop and evaluate process-based models to understand mechanisms and uncertainties in soil carbon responses to climate change.
      Our modeling work emphasizes structural uncertainty (how different model structures produce divergent projections) and the trade-off
      between model realism and uncertainty amplification when complexity increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We specifically target processes that govern long-term soil carbon dynamics—turnover time and microbial carbon use efficiency—
      and use multiple data streams (e.g., radiocarbon, incubations, and profile datasets) to quantify these processes and diagnose
      why models can overestimate sequestration under global change scenarios.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div style="height:20px;"></div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      We use machine learning and deep learning to upscale sparse but information-rich measurements (especially soil radiocarbon)
      and to identify dominant drivers of soil carbon persistence and storage at global scale. Our ML-based upscaling enables
      grid-to-grid comparisons with Earth system models, revealing where models overestimate sequestration and where apparent
      multi-model agreement can mask deeper mechanistic inconsistencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond prediction, we use ML for mechanism discovery—e.g., quantifying the relative influence of carbon use efficiency versus
      other processes—and to build ML-enabled benchmarking and emulator frameworks that support scalable diagnosis, uncertainty mapping,
      and model development.
