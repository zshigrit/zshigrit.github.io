<h1>Teaching</h1>

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>
My teaching integrates quantitative rigor with ecological intuition.
I emphasize three principles: connecting the big picture, engaging students
through interaction, and building quantitative confidence.
</p>

<p>
I aim to help students understand how ecological theory,
biogeochemistry, and modeling connect within the broader landscape
of biological science. In my courses, theoretical concepts are translated
into computational form using mathematical models, statistical analysis,
and coding exercises. I view teaching as a two-way learning process,
where discussion, curiosity, and collaborative exploration are essential.
</p>


<h2 style="margin-top:36px;">Courses</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists</strong><br>
  Introduction to hypothesis testing, ANOVA, multiple comparisons, and
  application of statistical methods to biological experiments.</li>

  <li style="margin-top:14px;"><strong>Regression Analysis</strong><br>
  Emphasis on generalized linear models and linear mixed-effects models,
  with applications to ecological and biological datasets.</li>

  <li style="margin-top:14px;"><strong>Statistical Learning</strong><br>
  Modern machine learning methods, interpretability, and applications
  to biological systems including ecological, molecular, and image data.</li>

  <li style="margin-top:14px;"><strong>Ecosystem Modeling and Data Assimilation</strong><br>
  Integration of process-based ecosystem models, Bayesian inference,
  and data assimilation techniques for terrestrial carbon cycling.</li>

  <li style="margin-top:14px;"><strong>Frontiers in Global Change Biology (Seminar)</strong><br>
  Critical discussion of recent research on climate–biosphere interactions
  and scientific communication.</li>
</ul>


<h2 style="margin-top:36px;">Mentorship</h2>

<p>
I mentor graduate and undergraduate students in ecosystem modeling,
model benchmarking, microbial–soil interactions, and machine-learning-assisted
model development. My goal is to cultivate scientific independence,
critical thinking, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
</p>

<p>
Through hands-on engagement with authentic research datasets,
students gain practical experience in quantitative analysis and
data-driven ecological reasoning.
