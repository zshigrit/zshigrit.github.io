<h1>Teaching</h1>

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>
My teaching integrates quantitative rigor with ecological intuition.
I emphasize three principles: connecting the big picture, engaging students
through interaction, and building quantitative confidence.
</p>

<p>
I aim to help students understand how ecological theory,
biogeochemistry, and modeling connect within the broader landscape
of biological science. In my courses, theoretical concepts are translated
into computational form using mathematical models, statistical analysis,
and coding exercises. I view teaching as a two-way learning process,
where discussion, curiosity, and collaborative exploration are essential.

  and data assimilation techniques for terrestrial carbon cycling.</li>

  <li style="margin-top:14px;"><strong>Machine learning and its application in ecology</strong><br>
  This course introduces fundamental machine learning concepts and their applications in ecological research. Students will learn core methods such as regression, classification, 
  neural networks, and model evaluation, with emphasis on analyzing ecological data and improving predictive understanding of ecological processes. 
  Through hands-on coding exercises and case studies, the course demonstrates how machine learning can support ecological modeling, forecasting, and data integration.</li>
